# Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO)

Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO) is a community-developed ontology/model, which is intended to serve as a consistent foundation for standardized information representation across the cyber security domain/ecosystem.

Specific information representations focused on individual cyber security subdomains (cyber investigation, computer/network defense, threat intelligence, malware analysis, vulnerability research, offensive/hack-back operations, etc.) can be be based on UCO and defined as appropriate subsets of UCO constructs.

Through this approach not only are domain-focused representations defined consistently but they also can take advantage of shared APIs and information can flow in an automated fashion across subdomain boundaries.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a foundation for broader community involvement in defining what to represent and how.

### Current Release
The current release of UCO is 0.9.1.

UCO 0.9.1 implements a starting point in UCO for ontology version designation and backwards-compatibility tracking. OWL versioning features are implemented and tested on top of UCO 0.9.0, as part of demonstrating version incrementing for UCO 1.0.0 and exercising the documentation deployment process. No other changes are implemented since UCO 0.9.0.

More detail of improvements is documented in the [UCO 0.9.1 release notes](https://unifiedcyberontology.org/releases/0.9.1/).
