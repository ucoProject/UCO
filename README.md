# Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO)

Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO) is a community-developed ontology/model, which is intended to serve as a consistent foundation for standardized information representation across the cyber security domain/ecosystem.

Specific information representations focused on individual cyber security subdomains (cyber investigation, computer/network defense, threat intelligence, malware analysis, vulnerability research, offensive/hack-back operations, etc.) can be be based on UCO and defined as appropriate subsets of UCO constructs.

Through this approach not only are domain-focused representations defined consistently but they also can take advantage of shared APIs and information can flow in an automated fashion across subdomain boundaries.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a foundation for broader community involvement in defining what to represent and how.

### Current Release
The current release of UCO is 1.2.0.

UCO 1.2.0 incorporates required refinements and updates, building on the stable 1.0.0 release.  Following [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), additive improvements will continue to be accepted, but backwards-incompatible changes will be scheduled only for the 2.0.0 release, which will come after at least 6 months to possibly 12 months.

More detail of improvements is documented in the [UCO 1.2.0 release notes](https://unifiedcyberontology.org/releases/1.2.0/).
