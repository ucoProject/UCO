# NOTE - this recipe makes an allowance for a certain failure type
# reported by pyshacl.  Pyshacl will exit status 1 in the case where
# "DataGraph is Non-Conformant".  This XFAIL test is intenced to
# generate a non-conformance result, and feed that result forward to
# pytest.  Hence, the Make recipe allows for an exit status of 0 or 1.
# (0 would cause an expected failure later in pytest.)
# Note that should another issue cause an exit status of 1, pytest will
# fail because the result validation-graph file would not have expected
# characteristics.
